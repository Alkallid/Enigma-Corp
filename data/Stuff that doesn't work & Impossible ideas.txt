# The problem with these things is that they don't give a place for the turret or gun port to go. The only fix that I can think of is going through each and every ship and adding additional port and mount coordinates, but that's just be painful and tedious. Maybe later.

	description "Somebody thought it would be funny to remove the computer on an anti-missile turret that makes it shoot at missiles and change it to fire on ships instead. During testing, it was found to do surprisingly well against ships who had already had their shields depleted. Because of this, Enigma Corp started mass producing them as Anti-Drone Turrets, and changed the ammunition slightly to be able to travel further to hit drones."
	description "Brought to you by Enigma Corp."

# Going to replace this thing with something else, but the main problem is that it's impossible to get it to auto hit drones as far as I can tell. If anyone figures out how to get a specific turret to auto attack on specific targets (e.g. allies, drones, fighters, only heavy warships, etc.) that's be amazing.

# These have the same problems as the weapon converters, they don't give a place for the fighters and drones to spawn. They don't even expand the bays either.

# Leech Beam: 20% of the damage dealt is returned as health. A similar idea is to leech off your own shield and cause massive damage in return.
